To control the ENC28J60 Ethernet controller using bit-bang SPI in MINT, we need to implement a software-based SPI protocol to communicate with the chip, as MINT does not have native SPI hardware support. The ENC28J60 requires precise timing for SPI communication, and MINT's minimalist design (16-bit integers, byte-code interpreter, and limited memory) means we must optimize for efficiency while adhering to the constraints outlined in the SJ Manual.

### Approach
1. **Understand ENC28J60 SPI Requirements**:
   - The ENC28J60 uses SPI mode 0 (CPOL=0, CPHA=0), where data is sampled on the rising edge of SCK and shifted out on the falling edge.
   - SPI commands include single-byte reads/writes and multi-byte operations (e.g., buffer reads/writes).
   - Typical SPI pins: SCK (clock), MOSI (master out, slave in), MISO (master in, slave out), CS (chip select).
   - The ENC28J60 supports clock speeds up to 20 MHz, but bit-banging in MINT will be slower due to interpreter overhead, so we'll aim for reliable communication at a lower speed.

2. **MINT Constraints**:
   - Use single-letter variables (a-z) and functions (A-Z).
   - No floating-point; use 16-bit signed integers or 32-bit intermediate results.
   - Memory is limited (2 KB RAM), so keep data structures small.
   - Use delays `()` for timing control, as precise hardware timing isn't available.
   - Comments must be on separate lines to avoid buffer issues.
   - All code must be error-free to prevent interpreter corruption.

3. **Bit-Bang SPI Implementation**:
   - Define GPIO pins for SCK, MOSI, MISO, and CS, mapped to I/O ports.
   - Implement SPI bit-banging by manually toggling SCK and MOSI, reading MISO.
   - Create functions for ENC28J60 operations: read/write control registers, read/write buffer memory, and initialization.

4. **ENC28J60 Initialization**:
   - Configure the ENC28J60 for basic Ethernet operation (e.g., set MAC address, enable packet reception).
   - Handle SPI commands like Read Control Register (RCR), Write Control Register (WCR), and buffer operations.

### Assumptions
- The ENC28J60 is connected to I/O ports accessible via MINT's `/O` (output) and `/I` (input) operators.
- Example port assignments:
  - CS: Port 0x10 (active low)
  - SCK: Port 0x11
  - MOSI: Port 0x12
  - MISO: Port 0x13
- The system runs at a speed where a delay of `1()` provides sufficient timing for SPI (adjustable based on testing).
- The code focuses on basic initialization and packet reception; advanced features (e.g., interrupts) are omitted for simplicity.

### Explanation of the Code
- **Function A: SPI Initialize**
  - Sets CS high (inactive), SCK low, and MOSI low to prepare for SPI communication.
  - Uses `/O` to write to the respective I/O ports.

- **Function B: SPI Send/Receive Byte**
  - Takes input byte in variable `b`, stores it in `n`.
  - Loops 8 times to send each bit:
    - Extracts the MSB of `n` using right shift (`}`) and bitwise AND (`&`).
    - Writes the bit to MOSI port.
    - Toggles SCK high, waits, reads MISO, and shifts the received bit into `r`.
    - Toggles SCK low and shifts `n` left for the next bit.
  - Returns the received byte in `r`.

- **Function C: SPI Start**
  - Sets CS low to select the ENC28J60.

- **Function D: SPI End**
  - Sets CS high to deselect the ENC28J60.

- **Function E: Write Control Register**
  - Takes register address (`a`) and value (`v`).
  - Sends the WCR command (opcode 010 + address) followed by the value.
  - Uses SPI start, send/receive, and end functions.

- **Function F: Read Control Register**
  - Takes register address (`a`).
  - Sends the RCR command (opcode 000 + address), followed by a dummy byte to receive the register value.
  - Returns the value in `r`.

- **Function G: Soft Reset**
  - Sends the soft reset command (0xFF) to reset the ENC28J60.
  - Adds a delay to allow the chip to stabilize.

- **Function H: ENC28J60 Initialize**
  - Initializes SPI and performs a soft reset.
  - Configures key registers in Bank 0:
    - Sets receive buffer pointers (ERXST, ERXND, ERXRDPT).
    - Enables broadcast packets (ERXFCON).
    - Configures MAC settings (MACON1, MACON3).
    - Sets a sample MAC address.
    - Enables packet reception (ECON1).
  - Uses function E for register writes.

- **Function I: Test Read EREVID**
  - Reads the EREVID register (0x1B) to verify communication.
  - Prints the chip revision ID (e.g., 0x06 for ENC28J60).

- **Function J: Port Definitions**
  - Assigns I/O port numbers for CS, SCK, MOSI, and MISO.

- **Main Execution**
  - Calls `J` to set port definitions.
  - Calls `H` to initialize the ENC28J60.
  - Calls `I` to test communication by reading EREVID.

### Usage
1. **Upload the Code**:
   - Strip comments and place each function on a single line (as per MINT requirements).
   - Upload to the MINT interpreter via a text transfer method.
   - Ensure each function ends with a `>` prompt echoed back.

2. **Run the Code**:
   - At the `>` prompt, the code runs automatically (calls J, H, I).
   - It initializes the ENC28J60 and prints the EREVID value to verify communication.

3. **Expected Output**:
   - If successful, it prints a number (e.g., 6 for EREVID = 0x06).
   - If no output or incorrect value, check wiring, port assignments, or SPI timing.

### Implementation Considerations

#### Timing Requirements
- The ENC28J60 requires precise SPI timing. The `1()` delays in function `B` (SPI send/receive) may need adjustment based on the MINT interpreter's execution speed and the ENC28J60's clock tolerance (up to 20 MHz).
- If communication fails, test with longer delays, such as `2()` or `5()`, to ensure reliable clock edge detection.
- The soft reset delay in function `G` (`100()`) should be verified and adjusted if the chip does not stabilize post-reset.

#### Memory Constraints
- The code is optimized to use minimal variables (single-letter, lowercase `a-z`) and avoids large arrays to fit within MINT's 2 KB RAM.
- Avoid introducing complex loops or large data structures to prevent memory corruption, as MINT lacks stack/heap overflow protection.

#### Error Handling
- The current implementation assumes correct wiring and valid I/O port access.
- For production use, add error checking, such as validating the EREVID value (expected: 0x06) after initialization, to confirm successful communication.
- Monitor system variables `/c` (carry) and `/r` (remainder/overflow) during arithmetic operations to detect potential overflows.

#### Limitations
- The code focuses on ENC28J60 initialization and basic register access (read/write control registers).
- Bit-banging SPI in MINT is slower than hardware SPI, limiting performance for high-speed Ethernet tasks like rapid packet processing.
- Packet transmission and reception are not implemented but can be added with additional functions (see "Extending the Code" below).

#### Code Formatting
- Each function is written on a single line without inline comments, as required for MINT interpreter compatibility.
- Comments are provided for clarity but must be stripped before uploading to avoid buffer issues.
- After each function, the interpreter echoes a `>` prompt when loaded via text transfer.

#### Execution Flow
- The code automatically executes by calling:
  - `J`: Defines I/O port assignments.
  - `H`: Initializes the ENC28J60.
  - `I`: Tests communication by reading the EREVID register.
- Upon successful execution, it prints the EREVID value (e.g., 6 for 0x06) to the console.

#### I/O Port Assignments
- Chip Select (CS): 0x10 (active low)
- Serial Clock (SCK): 0x11
- Master Out Slave In (MOSI): 0x12
- Master In Slave Out (MISO): 0x13
- Modify these in function `J` if different ports are used in your hardware setup.

#### Customization
- Adjust SPI delays (`1()` in `B`, `100()` in `G`) to match your system's timing characteristics.
- Update port assignments in `J` to align with your hardware configuration.
- Ensure all code is error-free, as MINT's interpreter will fail on syntax or logical errors.

### Testing and Debugging

#### Verifying SPI Communication
- Use function `I` to read the EREVID register (address 0x1B). A correct value (e.g., 0x06) confirms functional SPI communication.
- If no output or an incorrect value is received:
  - Verify I/O port assignments in function `J`.
  - Check physical wiring between the ENC28J60 and the MINT system.
  - Inspect power supply and grounding for the ENC28J60.

#### Monitoring SPI Signals
- Use an oscilloscope or logic analyzer to observe SCK, MOSI, MISO, and CS signals.
- Ensure:
  - SCK toggles correctly (low-to-high transitions).
  - MOSI data aligns with SCK falling edges.
  - MISO data is sampled on SCK rising edges.
  - CS goes low during transactions and high afterward.

#### Adjusting Timing
- If the ENC28J60 misses clock edges or returns inconsistent data, increase the delays in function `B` (e.g., from `1()` to `2()` or `5()`).
- Test incrementally to find the shortest reliable delay for optimal performance.

#### Validating Register Writes
- After writing to control registers (using function `E`), read back the values (using function `F`) to confirm correct configuration.
- Example: After setting ERXFCON (0x38) to 0x80, read it back to verify.

### Extending the Code

To support packet reception and transmission, consider the following additions:

1. **Buffer Read Function**:
   - Implement a function to read packet data from the ENC28J60's buffer using opcode 00111010 (0x3A).
   - Send the opcode via SPI, followed by reading multiple bytes into a MINT array.

2. **Buffer Write Function**:
   - Create a function to write packet data to the buffer using opcode 01111010 (0x7A).
   - Send the opcode, followed by the data bytes to transmit.

3. **Packet Reception Polling**:
   - Add a polling loop to check the PKTIF flag in the EIR register (address 0x1C, bit 7).
   - When set, trigger buffer read to retrieve the received packet.

4. **Ethernet Frame Processing**:
   - Implement functions to parse Ethernet frames and handle protocols like ARP or ICMP.
   - Store frame data in a small array and process headers using bitwise operations.

These extensions require careful memory management due to MINT's 2 KB RAM limit. If needed, I can provide specific MINT code for these features.

### Potential Problems in the tec-TCPIP Project

The tec-TCPIP repository is an ambitious but embryonic effort to implement a TCP/IP protocol stack in Forth for the vintage TEC-1 computer, using the MINT interpreter and an ENC28J60 Ethernet module. Based on the repository's content (primarily a detailed README with embedded MINT code for bit-banged SPI and basic chip initialization), the project is in a very early prototype stage. It focuses on low-level hardware control rather than a complete stack, and several inherent and implementation-specific issues could hinder progress or reliability. Below, I outline the key potential problems, categorized for clarity, drawing directly from the project's constraints, code, and status.

#### 1. **Project Maturity and Scope Mismatch**
   - **Incomplete Implementation**: The README provides code only for ENC28J60 initialization, register read/write, and a basic test (reading the EREVID register). There's no code for core TCP/IP functionalities like packet transmission/reception, ARP/ICMP handling, or higher-layer protocols (e.g., TCP/UDP). The "Extending the Code" section hints at additions (e.g., buffer ops with opcodes 0x3A/0x7A), but these are undeveloped, leaving the "TCP/IP stack" more aspirational than functional. This could lead to scope creep or abandonment if the basics prove too challenging.
   - **Lack of Repository Structure**: No separate source files, build scripts, or tests—everything is crammed into the README. This makes collaboration, versioning, or reuse difficult. No releases or packages mean no easy way to share or deploy the code.
   - **Inactive Development**: No visible commits, issues, or pull requests suggest stalled progress. As of October 2025, the repo appears dormant, which risks bitrot (e.g., outdated assumptions about MINT or ENC28J60 errata) without community input.

#### 2. **Hardware and Interface Challenges**
   - **Bit-Banged SPI Limitations**: MINT lacks native SPI hardware, so the code manually toggles pins (SCK, MOSI, MISO, CS) via I/O ports. This interpreter-overhead approach will be glacially slow (far below the ENC28J60's 20 MHz max), potentially causing packet loss or timeouts in real Ethernet use. The fixed `1()` delays in the SPI byte function (B) assume untested system speeds—too short, and edges misalign; too long, and throughput crawls.
   - **Assumed Port Mappings**: Hardcoded I/O ports (e.g., CS at 0x10, SCK at 0x11) in function J may not match all TEC-1 setups. Mismatched wiring could silently fail (no output from the EREVID test), requiring hardware-specific tweaks without debug tools.
   - **No Interrupt or Polling Support**: The code omits ENC28J60 interrupts (e.g., via INT pin) or efficient polling (e.g., EIR register for PKTIF), forcing busy-wait loops that waste MINT's limited cycles and could lock up the system during packet waits.

#### 3. **Software and Language Constraints**
   - **MINT-Specific Fragility**: MINT's design (16-bit signed ints, no floats, single-letter vars/functions, 2KB RAM, no overflow protection) is a double-edged sword. The code is optimized (e.g., bitwise ops for bit extraction), but risks include:
     - **Memory Exhaustion**: Even small extensions (e.g., packet buffers) could overflow RAM, corrupting the interpreter. No heap/stack checks exacerbate this.
     - **No Error Handling**: Functions like E (write register) assume success; a failed SPI transaction (e.g., due to noise) propagates garbage. The test (I) only checks EREVID post-init but doesn't validate configs (e.g., read back MACON1).
     - **Interpreter Sensitivity**: Inline comments cause buffer issues, so the README stresses stripping them—but user errors in upload could crash MINT. Syntax/logic bugs halt execution without graceful recovery.
   - **Timing and Precision Issues**: Delays like `100()` for soft reset (G) or `1()` per SPI bit are empirical guesses. On varying TEC-1 clocks, this could fail SPI mode 0 compliance (sample on rising edge), yielding corrupt reads (e.g., wrong EREVID). No adaptive timing or calibration routine.
   - **Portability Pitfalls**: Tied to MINT's operators (`/O`, `/I`, `()`, `{` for shifts), the code won't port easily to other Forth dialects without rewrite. Assumptions like `#FF` for hex literals may vary.

#### 4. **Reliability and Testing Gaps**
   - **Untested Assumptions**: The example MAC (00:04:A3:12:34:56) and broadcast-only reception (ERXFCON=0x80) suit demos but ignore real-world needs like unicast filtering or collision detection. No simulation or emulator support for offline testing.
   - **Debugging Hurdles**: Relies on oscilloscope/logic analyzer for SPI signals, inaccessible to most hobbyists. Console output is minimal (just EREVID print via `.`), with no logging for failures. Adjusting delays requires iterative uploads, slowing iteration.
   - **Edge Cases Ignored**: No handling for SPI collisions, power glitches, or ENC28J60 errata (e.g., silicon revisions affecting timing). Broadcast-only mode floods the tiny RAM with junk packets.

#### 5. **Broader Practical and Sustainability Issues**
   - **Performance Bottlenecks**: Even if extended, bit-banging + MINT overhead limits throughput to kbps, unsuitable for TCP/IP (which needs reliable ~Mbps for handshakes). Full stack would compound this with checksums, fragmentation, and state machines—all in <2KB.
   - **Dependency Risks**: Links to external ENC28J60 modules (e.g., Core Electronics) assume availability; supply chain issues for vintage parts could halt hardware tests. No fallback for alternative chips.
   - **Community and Documentation Overload**: The README is exhaustive (great for clarity) but overwhelming for newcomers, with dense MINT syntax. Without issues/PRs, fixes rely on the solo maintainer (SteveJustin1963), risking knowledge silos.
   - **Legal/Standards Compliance**: Custom MAC and minimal configs might violate Ethernet standards (e.g., IEEE 802.3), causing interoperability fails in mixed networks.

In summary, while the README demonstrates deep knowledge of MINT and ENC28J60 quirks, the project risks stalling due to its niche focus, unproven low-level code, and MINT's punitive constraints. Success would require hardware prototyping, extensive timing tweaks, and incremental extensions—but without activity, it may remain a proof-of-concept. If you're involved, prioritize emulator-based testing and modularizing the code beyond the README.
 
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


To address the potential problems identified in the tec-TCPIP project (incomplete implementation, hardware limitations, MINT constraints, reliability issues, and sustainability concerns), here are targeted solutions to improve the project's viability, performance, and maintainability. Each solution aligns with the project's current state (a README with MINT code for ENC28J60 initialization) and aims to advance it toward a functional TCP/IP stack on the TEC-1. Suggestions are prioritized for practicality within MINT's constraints and the vintage hardware context.

---

### 1. **Addressing Project Maturity and Scope Mismatch**
   **Problem**: The project is a prototype with only ENC28J60 initialization, lacking core TCP/IP functionality, proper repository structure, and active development.

   **Solutions**:
   - **Modularize Code Structure**:
     - Move the MINT code from the README into separate `.mint` files (e.g., `spi.mint`, `enc28j60.mint`, `init.mint`) in the GitHub repository. This improves versioning and collaboration.
     - Add a `Makefile` or simple script to concatenate and upload files to the TEC-1, easing deployment.
     - Example: Create `spi.mint` for functions A-D, `enc28j60.mint` for E-I, and a main file calling J, H, I.
   - **Incremental TCP/IP Development**:
     - Implement minimal packet handling next (e.g., receive Ethernet frames via buffer read, opcode 0x3A). Start with ARP to resolve MAC-to-IP mappings, as it’s simpler than TCP.
     - Add a function (e.g., `K`) to poll EIR.PKTIF (0x1C, bit 7) and read packets into a small 128-byte array to fit MINT’s 2KB RAM.
     - Example MINT snippet for buffer read:
       ```
       :K
       // Poll PKTIF and read packet
       #1C a! F 7 & r! // Check EIR.PKTIF
       r 0 = ; // Exit if no packet
       #3A b! C b B // Send buffer read opcode
       128 ( // Read 128 bytes
         0 B r! // Read byte to r
         r t! t n + ! // Store to array at n
         1 n +!
       )
       D
       ;
       ```
   - **Revive Development**:
     - Open GitHub issues for tasks (e.g., “Implement ARP”, “Test SPI timing”) to attract contributors and track progress.
     - Commit the README code as a baseline and push regular updates, even small ones, to signal activity.
     - Engage retro-computing communities (e.g., on X or forums like 6502.org) to find collaborators familiar with Forth or TEC-1.

---

### 2. **Mitigating Hardware and Interface Challenges**
   **Problem**: Bit-banged SPI is slow, port mappings are rigid, and interrupts/polling are unsupported, limiting Ethernet performance.

   **Solutions**:
   - **Optimize SPI Timing**:
     - Replace fixed `1()` delays in function B with a configurable variable (e.g., `d` for delay). Test values like `2()`, `5()`, or `10()` on real hardware to balance reliability and speed.
     - Add a calibration routine to measure TEC-1 clock cycles and adjust delays dynamically.
     - Example calibration in MINT:
       ```
       :L
       // Set delay based on test read
       1 d! // Start with delay=1
       #1B a! F r! // Read EREVID
       r #06 = ; // If 0x06, keep d
       d 1 +! d 10 < ; L // Try next delay
       ;
       ```
   - **Flexible Port Configuration**:
     - Store port assignments in variables initialized at boot, allowing users to redefine CS/SCK/MOSI/MISO without editing function J.
     - Example:
       ```
       :J
       // Define ports dynamically
       p /I c! // Read CS port from input
       q /I s! // Read SCK port
       r /I m! // MOSI
       t /I i! // MISO
       ;
       ```
     - Document default ports (0x10-0x13) but encourage users to input their setup via `/I`.
   - **Basic Polling Support**:
     - Add a lightweight polling loop in the main execution to check for received packets (EIR.PKTIF) instead of interrupts, as MINT lacks interrupt support.
     - Example: Modify main to loop on function K (above) after initialization:
       ```
       J H // Init
       ( I K ) // Loop: test EREVID, check packets
       ```
   - **Hardware Validation**:
     - Provide a wiring diagram in the README (e.g., ASCII art or link to a Core Electronics schematic) to ensure correct ENC28J60 connections.
     - Suggest checking ENC28J60 power (3.3V, stable ground) and crystal (25 MHz) to avoid signal issues.

---

### 3. **Overcoming Software and Language Constraints**
   **Problem**: MINT’s 2KB RAM, lack of error handling, and interpreter quirks (e.g., no inline comments, overflow risks) limit robustness.

   **Solutions**:
   - **Memory Management**:
     - Reserve a fixed buffer (e.g., 256 bytes) for packet data and track usage with a pointer (e.g., `n` in function K). Avoid dynamic allocation to prevent RAM overruns.
     - Monitor `/c` (carry) and `/r` (remainder) after arithmetic (e.g., in B for shifts) to detect overflows. Halt with an error code if detected.
     - Example overflow check:
       ```
       :B
       b n! 0 r! 8 (
         n 7 } t! t 1 & m /O
         1 s /O 1 () i /I 1 & u!
         r { u | r! /c 1 = ; // Halt on overflow
         0 s /O 1 () n { n!
       )
       r
       ;
       ```
   - **Error Handling**:
     - Add validation after register writes (E) by reading back values (F) and comparing. Print errors to console for debugging.
     - Example:
       ```
       :E
       a 40 | b! C b B v B D
       a F t! t v = ; // Verify write
       #EE . // Print error code
       ;
       ```
     - Check EREVID in function I; if not 0x06, print a diagnostic and halt.
   - **Interpreter-Friendly Code**:
     - Create a script to strip comments before upload, ensuring compliance with MINT’s no-inline-comment rule. Share it in the repo (e.g., `strip_comments.py`).
     - Test code in a MINT emulator (if available) to catch syntax errors before hardware deployment.
   - **Portability**:
     - Document MINT-specific operators (`/O`, `{`, `()`) in the README with equivalents in standard Forth (e.g., ANS Forth) to ease porting.
     - Use preprocessor-like variables for hex literals (e.g., `#FF` as `255`) if other Forths are targeted.

---

### 4. **Improving Reliability and Testing**
   **Problem**: Untested code, minimal debugging output, and ignored edge cases reduce reliability.

   **Solutions**:
   - **Emulator-Based Testing**:
     - Use a Z80 emulator with MINT support (e.g., a custom TEC-1 emulator) to test SPI and ENC28J60 interactions without hardware. If none exists, document a setup with QEMU or Z80Sim.
     - Simulate ENC28J60 responses (e.g., EREVID=0x06) to verify function F.
   - **Enhanced Diagnostics**:
     - Expand function I to print multiple register values (e.g., ERXST, MACON1) post-init to confirm setup.
     - Example:
       ```
       :I
       #1B a! F . // EREVID
       #C0 a! F . // MACON1
       #38 a! F . // ERXFCON
       ;

     - Add a debug mode toggling verbose output via a variable (e.g., `z 1 =` for debug on).
   - **Edge Case Handling**:
     - Check for ENC28J60 errata (e.g., silicon rev-specific SPI quirks) in the Microchip datasheet and add workarounds (e.g., extra delays for older chips).
     - Filter unicast packets in ERXFCON (not just broadcast) to reduce RAM pressure. Example: Set ERXFCON to 0xA1 (UCEN+BCEN).
   - **Physical Debugging**:
     - Recommend affordable USB logic analyzers (e.g., Saleae clones) for SPI signal checks, with setup instructions in the README.
     - Add a test function to toggle SCK/MOSI and read MISO repeatedly, logging raw bits to isolate wiring issues.

### 5. **Enhancing Practicality and Sustainability**
   **Problem**: Slow performance, supply chain risks, overwhelming documentation, and solo maintenance threaten long-term success.

   **Solutions**:
   - **Performance Optimization**:
     - Unroll the SPI loop in function B for critical operations to reduce interpreter overhead. Example:
       ```
       :B
       b n! 0 r!
       n 7 } 1 & m /O 1 s /O 1 () i /I 1 & r! 0 s /O 1 ()
       n { n! // Repeat 7 more times
       r
       ;
       ```
     - Prioritize lightweight protocols (e.g., UDP over TCP) for initial stack to minimize state machine complexity.
   - **Hardware Alternatives**:
     - Document fallback Ethernet chips (e.g., W5100, simpler SPI interface) if ENC28J60 availability wanes. List pin-compatible modules.
     - Test with multiple ENC28J60 vendors to catch module-specific quirks (e.g., crystal tolerances).
   - **Improved Documentation**:
     - Split the README into sections: Overview, Setup, Code Explanation, Debugging, and Future Work. Add a quick-start guide for beginners.
     - Include a FAQ addressing common issues (e.g., “No EREVID output? Check wiring at port 0x13”).
     - Share a video or screenshots of a working setup on X to attract hobbyists.
   - **Community Engagement**:
     - Post updates on X (@SteveJustin1963) linking to the repo, asking for testers or Forth experts to contribute.
     - Create a wiki or discussion board on GitHub for user questions, reducing maintainer burden.
     - License the code (e.g., MIT) to clarify usage and encourage forks.

### 6. **Specific Next Steps**
To kickstart progress:
1. **Commit Current Code**: Move the README code to files, push to GitHub, and tag a v0.1 release.
2. **Test on Hardware**: Run the existing code on a TEC-1 with ENC28J60, tweak delays, and confirm EREVID=0x06.
3. **Add Packet Read**: Implement function K (above) to read one Ethernet frame, logging its first 14 bytes (header) to console.
4. **Open Issues**: Create tasks for ARP, buffer write (opcode 0x7A), and timing calibration.
5. **Seek Feedback**: Share the repo on retro-computing forums or X, targeting Z80/Forth enthusiasts.

These solutions leverage MINT’s strengths (compact code, bitwise ops) while addressing its weaknesses (memory, speed). They also balance the TEC-1’s vintage constraints with modern development practices, aiming for a minimal but functional TCP/IP stack. If you need detailed MINT code for any suggestion (e.g., ARP parsing), let me know!
