Building a simple **TCP/IP stack for an 8-bit computer** is a challenging but achievable task if you work within strict constraints and understand the networking layers deeply.

Here‚Äôs a clear breakdown of **what‚Äôs absolutely necessary**, **what can be simplified or skipped**, and **what you‚Äôll need in terms of hardware/software**.

---

### ‚úÖ 1. **Decide Your Protocol Scope**

You **do not need full TCP/IP**. For an 8-bit machine, it's very common to **skip TCP** entirely and use **UDP/IP or just ICMP/IP (like Ping)**.

**Common minimal stack layers:**

```
Application Layer ‚Üí (UDP optional) ‚Üí IP ‚Üí ARP ‚Üí Ethernet
```

If you can do **IP + UDP**, you can:

* Send/receive packets
* Build DNS, NTP, basic web clients (e.g., HTTP GET)
* Skip complex TCP state tracking (SYN, ACK, timeouts)

---

### ‚úÖ 2. **Minimum Components to Implement**

Here‚Äôs a checklist of what you need to implement, assuming you're doing **UDP over IP**:

#### üîπ A. **Ethernet Driver**

* Read/write raw frames to/from Ethernet controller (like ENC28J60 or WIZnet W5100)
* Handle MAC addresses
* Interface via SPI (common for 8-bit)

#### üîπ B. **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)**

* Respond to ARP requests
* Issue ARP requests to find MAC of router/gateway

#### üîπ C. **IP Layer**

* Build/send IP headers (with checksum)
* Receive and validate IP packets (parse header, check length and checksum)
* Handle fragmentation (usually ignored for simplicity)

#### üîπ D. **ICMP (Optional but useful)**

* Reply to ping (ICMP echo request)
* Helps test if your device is alive

#### üîπ E. **UDP Layer**

* Build UDP headers (checksum optional)
* Handle ports
* Send/receive data to/from application

#### üîπ F. **Application Layer (Your Code)**

* Example: Simple HTTP GET, NTP time query, or telemetry packet sender

### ‚úÖ 3. **Memory Considerations**

You're on an 8-bit computer ‚Äî likely with **a few KB of RAM**.

Tips:

* Use fixed-size packet buffers (e.g., 512 bytes)
* Avoid dynamic allocation
* Process data *in place* as much as possible

---

### ‚úÖ 4. **Hardware You‚Äôll Need**

* **Microcontroller or 8-bit CPU system** (e.g., AVR, Z80, 6502, 8051, or similar)
* **Ethernet controller**:

  * ‚úÖ \[ENC28J60 (Ethernet over SPI)] ‚Äî Cheap, but needs full stack on your side
  * ‚úÖ \[WIZnet W5500/W5100] ‚Äî Has built-in TCP/UDP stack (offloads your job)
  * ‚õî Don't use USB Ethernet ‚Äî too complex for 8-bit unless you use a host shield

---

### ‚úÖ 5. **Recommended Simplifications**

* Use **static IP** (no DHCP)
* Use **only UDP**
* Skip **DNS**, hardcode IPs (or add minimal DNS resolver later)
* Skip TCP ‚Äî it's memory-heavy and needs timers, retransmission, sliding window, etc.

---

### ‚úÖ 6. **Sample Projects to Learn From**

* **Adam Dunkels' uIP** (micro-IP): Very compact TCP/IP stack for 8/16-bit

  * [https://dunkels.com/adam/uip/](https://dunkels.com/adam/uip/)
* **RetroStack**: For Z80/6502-based homebrew computers
* **Mini-IP** or ‚ÄúIP stack in 512 bytes‚Äù style projects

---

### üß∞ Tools You Might Use

* **Wireshark** (to sniff and analyze your packets)
* **Tasm/CC65/SDCC/AVR-GCC** (to compile for your 8-bit platform)
* **Logic analyzer** (to debug SPI or Ethernet frames)

### üß† Summary: Absolute Minimum TCP/IP Stack for 8-bit

| Layer       | What You Need                                  |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Ethernet    | Frame send/receive, MAC handling               |
| ARP         | Resolve gateway MAC                            |
| IP          | Build/send IP headers, checksum, route to port |
| UDP (opt.)  | Send/receive to fixed ports, lightweight       |
| Application | Custom logic (e.g. send log, ping, etc.)       |
