To control the ENC28J60 Ethernet controller using bit-bang SPI in MINT, we need to implement a software-based SPI protocol to communicate with the chip, as MINT does not have native SPI hardware support. The ENC28J60 requires precise timing for SPI communication, and MINT's minimalist design (16-bit integers, byte-code interpreter, and limited memory) means we must optimize for efficiency while adhering to the constraints outlined in the SJ Manual.

### Approach
1. **Understand ENC28J60 SPI Requirements**:
   - The ENC28J60 uses SPI mode 0 (CPOL=0, CPHA=0), where data is sampled on the rising edge of SCK and shifted out on the falling edge.
   - SPI commands include single-byte reads/writes and multi-byte operations (e.g., buffer reads/writes).
   - Typical SPI pins: SCK (clock), MOSI (master out, slave in), MISO (master in, slave out), CS (chip select).
   - The ENC28J60 supports clock speeds up to 20 MHz, but bit-banging in MINT will be slower due to interpreter overhead, so we'll aim for reliable communication at a lower speed.

2. **MINT Constraints**:
   - Use single-letter variables (a-z) and functions (A-Z).
   - No floating-point; use 16-bit signed integers or 32-bit intermediate results.
   - Memory is limited (2 KB RAM), so keep data structures small.
   - Use delays `()` for timing control, as precise hardware timing isn't available.
   - Comments must be on separate lines to avoid buffer issues.
   - All code must be error-free to prevent interpreter corruption.

3. **Bit-Bang SPI Implementation**:
   - Define GPIO pins for SCK, MOSI, MISO, and CS, mapped to I/O ports.
   - Implement SPI bit-banging by manually toggling SCK and MOSI, reading MISO.
   - Create functions for ENC28J60 operations: read/write control registers, read/write buffer memory, and initialization.

4. **ENC28J60 Initialization**:
   - Configure the ENC28J60 for basic Ethernet operation (e.g., set MAC address, enable packet reception).
   - Handle SPI commands like Read Control Register (RCR), Write Control Register (WCR), and buffer operations.

### Assumptions
- The ENC28J60 is connected to I/O ports accessible via MINT's `/O` (output) and `/I` (input) operators.
- Example port assignments:
  - CS: Port 0x10 (active low)
  - SCK: Port 0x11
  - MOSI: Port 0x12
  - MISO: Port 0x13
- The system runs at a speed where a delay of `1()` provides sufficient timing for SPI (adjustable based on testing).
- The code focuses on basic initialization and packet reception; advanced features (e.g., interrupts) are omitted for simplicity.

### Explanation of the Code
- **Function A: SPI Initialize**
  - Sets CS high (inactive), SCK low, and MOSI low to prepare for SPI communication.
  - Uses `/O` to write to the respective I/O ports.

- **Function B: SPI Send/Receive Byte**
  - Takes input byte in variable `b`, stores it in `n`.
  - Loops 8 times to send each bit:
    - Extracts the MSB of `n` using right shift (`}`) and bitwise AND (`&`).
    - Writes the bit to MOSI port.
    - Toggles SCK high, waits, reads MISO, and shifts the received bit into `r`.
    - Toggles SCK low and shifts `n` left for the next bit.
  - Returns the received byte in `r`.

- **Function C: SPI Start**
  - Sets CS low to select the ENC28J60.

- **Function D: SPI End**
  - Sets CS high to deselect the ENC28J60.

- **Function E: Write Control Register**
  - Takes register address (`a`) and value (`v`).
  - Sends the WCR command (opcode 010 + address) followed by the value.
  - Uses SPI start, send/receive, and end functions.

- **Function F: Read Control Register**
  - Takes register address (`a`).
  - Sends the RCR command (opcode 000 + address), followed by a dummy byte to receive the register value.
  - Returns the value in `r`.

- **Function G: Soft Reset**
  - Sends the soft reset command (0xFF) to reset the ENC28J60.
  - Adds a delay to allow the chip to stabilize.

- **Function H: ENC28J60 Initialize**
  - Initializes SPI and performs a soft reset.
  - Configures key registers in Bank 0:
    - Sets receive buffer pointers (ERXST, ERXND, ERXRDPT).
    - Enables broadcast packets (ERXFCON).
    - Configures MAC settings (MACON1, MACON3).
    - Sets a sample MAC address.
    - Enables packet reception (ECON1).
  - Uses function E for register writes.

- **Function I: Test Read EREVID**
  - Reads the EREVID register (0x1B) to verify communication.
  - Prints the chip revision ID (e.g., 0x06 for ENC28J60).

- **Function J: Port Definitions**
  - Assigns I/O port numbers for CS, SCK, MOSI, and MISO.

- **Main Execution**
  - Calls `J` to set port definitions.
  - Calls `H` to initialize the ENC28J60.
  - Calls `I` to test communication by reading EREVID.

### Usage
1. **Upload the Code**:
   - Strip comments and place each function on a single line (as per MINT requirements).
   - Upload to the MINT interpreter via a text transfer method.
   - Ensure each function ends with a `>` prompt echoed back.

2. **Run the Code**:
   - At the `>` prompt, the code runs automatically (calls J, H, I).
   - It initializes the ENC28J60 and prints the EREVID value to verify communication.

3. **Expected Output**:
   - If successful, it prints a number (e.g., 6 for EREVID = 0x06).
   - If no output or incorrect value, check wiring, port assignments, or SPI timing.

### Implementation Considerations

#### Timing Requirements
- The ENC28J60 requires precise SPI timing. The `1()` delays in function `B` (SPI send/receive) may need adjustment based on the MINT interpreter's execution speed and the ENC28J60's clock tolerance (up to 20 MHz).
- If communication fails, test with longer delays, such as `2()` or `5()`, to ensure reliable clock edge detection.
- The soft reset delay in function `G` (`100()`) should be verified and adjusted if the chip does not stabilize post-reset.

#### Memory Constraints
- The code is optimized to use minimal variables (single-letter, lowercase `a-z`) and avoids large arrays to fit within MINT's 2 KB RAM.
- Avoid introducing complex loops or large data structures to prevent memory corruption, as MINT lacks stack/heap overflow protection.

#### Error Handling
- The current implementation assumes correct wiring and valid I/O port access.
- For production use, add error checking, such as validating the EREVID value (expected: 0x06) after initialization, to confirm successful communication.
- Monitor system variables `/c` (carry) and `/r` (remainder/overflow) during arithmetic operations to detect potential overflows.

#### Limitations
- The code focuses on ENC28J60 initialization and basic register access (read/write control registers).
- Bit-banging SPI in MINT is slower than hardware SPI, limiting performance for high-speed Ethernet tasks like rapid packet processing.
- Packet transmission and reception are not implemented but can be added with additional functions (see "Extending the Code" below).

#### Code Formatting
- Each function is written on a single line without inline comments, as required for MINT interpreter compatibility.
- Comments are provided for clarity but must be stripped before uploading to avoid buffer issues.
- After each function, the interpreter echoes a `>` prompt when loaded via text transfer.

#### Execution Flow
- The code automatically executes by calling:
  - `J`: Defines I/O port assignments.
  - `H`: Initializes the ENC28J60.
  - `I`: Tests communication by reading the EREVID register.
- Upon successful execution, it prints the EREVID value (e.g., 6 for 0x06) to the console.

#### I/O Port Assignments
- Chip Select (CS): 0x10 (active low)
- Serial Clock (SCK): 0x11
- Master Out Slave In (MOSI): 0x12
- Master In Slave Out (MISO): 0x13
- Modify these in function `J` if different ports are used in your hardware setup.

#### Customization
- Adjust SPI delays (`1()` in `B`, `100()` in `G`) to match your system's timing characteristics.
- Update port assignments in `J` to align with your hardware configuration.
- Ensure all code is error-free, as MINT's interpreter will fail on syntax or logical errors.

### Testing and Debugging

#### Verifying SPI Communication
- Use function `I` to read the EREVID register (address 0x1B). A correct value (e.g., 0x06) confirms functional SPI communication.
- If no output or an incorrect value is received:
  - Verify I/O port assignments in function `J`.
  - Check physical wiring between the ENC28J60 and the MINT system.
  - Inspect power supply and grounding for the ENC28J60.

#### Monitoring SPI Signals
- Use an oscilloscope or logic analyzer to observe SCK, MOSI, MISO, and CS signals.
- Ensure:
  - SCK toggles correctly (low-to-high transitions).
  - MOSI data aligns with SCK falling edges.
  - MISO data is sampled on SCK rising edges.
  - CS goes low during transactions and high afterward.

#### Adjusting Timing
- If the ENC28J60 misses clock edges or returns inconsistent data, increase the delays in function `B` (e.g., from `1()` to `2()` or `5()`).
- Test incrementally to find the shortest reliable delay for optimal performance.

#### Validating Register Writes
- After writing to control registers (using function `E`), read back the values (using function `F`) to confirm correct configuration.
- Example: After setting ERXFCON (0x38) to 0x80, read it back to verify.

### Extending the Code

To support packet reception and transmission, consider the following additions:

1. **Buffer Read Function**:
   - Implement a function to read packet data from the ENC28J60's buffer using opcode 00111010 (0x3A).
   - Send the opcode via SPI, followed by reading multiple bytes into a MINT array.

2. **Buffer Write Function**:
   - Create a function to write packet data to the buffer using opcode 01111010 (0x7A).
   - Send the opcode, followed by the data bytes to transmit.

3. **Packet Reception Polling**:
   - Add a polling loop to check the PKTIF flag in the EIR register (address 0x1C, bit 7).
   - When set, trigger buffer read to retrieve the received packet.

4. **Ethernet Frame Processing**:
   - Implement functions to parse Ethernet frames and handle protocols like ARP or ICMP.
   - Store frame data in a small array and process headers using bitwise operations.

These extensions require careful memory management due to MINT's 2 KB RAM limit. If needed, I can provide specific MINT code for these features.
